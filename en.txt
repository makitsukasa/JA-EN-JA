In the proposed method, JGG is used to find a global optimal solution. And, in the first search, the group size is reduced to find a good solution in a short time. Specifically, for the number of dimensions $n$ of the objective function in question, the group size $n_{spop}(\lt n_{pop})$ is set to a constant multiple of $n$.
In addition, the number of offspring produced in one crossover is also reduced as well as the population size. In the first part of the search, the offspring produced by crossover are likely to be better than the parent. When the number of evaluations of the objective function is the same, the number of generations can be increased by reducing the number of offspring individuals generated in one crossover. Frequent generational changes increase the chances that the generated excellent individuals will be selected as parents to use for crossover, so it can be expected to obtain excellent solutions with fewer evaluations. Let the number of child individuals generated in the early stage be $n_{schi}(\lt n_{chi})$.
After finding a good solution at the beginning of the search, the population size and the number of crossover children are sufficiently increased to find a global optimum solution and the search continues. In the latter half of the search, it is possible to use a good solution that can be found with a small number of evaluations in the early stages, so it can be expected to find a global optimum solution with a relatively small number of evaluations.
